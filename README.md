- Hi, I am andreas.
-
- It's the year 1348 now (2/3rds of 2Ô∏è022), and I decided to side-husttle some learning üòé.
- 
- This will hopefully lead me to somewhere better personally, and to somewhere further professionally.
- 
- I have started following the freeCodeCamp.org curriculum. 
- It seems a good starting point overall.
- 
- This specific learning trip will take me from: 
-   *HTML/CSS basics, to 
-   *JavaScript, where I think I want to concentrate for a while, and then to 
-   *Data and Python, which is my professional goal.
- The learning goal is to build my path, towards a better understanding of these technologies. 
- 
- The rough idea is to dedicate equal time in coding, reading, and gradually combine both in problem-solving.
- 
- Last time I followed similar courses was back in the early 1990s -at the time [of the second wave of] Black Metal emerged- in 
-   *Logo: I made the green turtle turn quite a few degrees left, right and all over the screen,
-   *QuickBASIC: I've built a game where you had to collect some falling !s while controling the letter U with the arrows,
-   *MsDOS/ terminal: commands...command, dir, cd, learning to use the help... all we care for was to play Jordan vs Bird-One on One before the class (only the losers played with Bird),
-   *some binary coding theory: with 0s and 1s, still got the notebooks...
-   *Data structures with MSAcces: can build a book collection, sure thing- 
- 
- Couple of early observations - they apply to the Black Metal scene as well: 
-   *not much have changed since the 90s
-   *quite a lot have changed since the 90s
-   
- My interests revolve around internet of things, data manipulation and data structures, software engineering and development, business inteligence, games.
- [also around history, the Balkans, Black Metal, Black Metal history of the Balkans, poetry, the Oxford Comma, and more]
